Twitter Analytics Tool
This is a simple Python-based tool to analyze Twitter engagement metrics, including likes, retweets, and mentions, from a user's timeline. The tool uses the Twitter API via the Tweepy library to collect tweet data and Pandas for analysis. Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for visualizing engagement metrics.

Features
Authenticate with Twitter API using OAuth credentials.
Fetch recent tweets from a userâ€™s timeline.
Analyze and visualize engagement metrics (likes, retweets).
Scatterplot visualization of likes vs retweets.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries:
tweepy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
Installation
Step 1: Install Python and Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the required dependencies by running:

bash
Copy
pip install tweepy pandas matplotlib seaborn
Step 2: Set up Twitter Developer Account
Go to the Twitter Developer Portal.
Create a new app to get your API Key, API Secret Key, Access Token, and Access Token Secret.
Step 3: Update Your Credentials
In the code (twitter_analytics.py), replace the placeholders with your actual Twitter API credentials:

python
Copy
API_KEY = 'your_api_key'
API_SECRET_KEY = 'your_api_secret_key'
ACCESS_TOKEN = 'your_access_token'
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = 'your_access_token_secret'
Usage
Step 1: Authenticate with Twitter API
The tool uses OAuth authentication to connect to the Twitter API. You need to provide your credentials for the script to work.

Step 2: Fetch Tweets from a User
The script fetches tweets from a specific Twitter user's timeline. By default, it fetches the last 100 tweets, but you can adjust the count parameter.

python
Copy
username = 'elonmusk'  # Replace with any Twitter username
tweets_df = get_user_tweets(api, username, count=100)
Step 3: Analyze and Visualize Engagement
The tool analyzes and visualizes engagement metrics, such as the number of likes, retweets, and mentions. You can view the scatterplot of likes vs. retweets for a quick comparison.

python
Copy
plot_engagement(tweets_df)
Example Output
Tweet Data Sample: The tool will display a DataFrame containing tweet metadata such as tweet creation time, likes, retweets, and mentions.
Scatterplot: The scatterplot visualizes the relationship between likes and retweets for the fetched tweets.
Example Workflow
python
Copy
# Authenticate and fetch data
api = authenticate_twitter(API_KEY, API_SECRET_KEY, ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)

# Get tweets from a user
tweets_df = get_user_tweets(api, 'elonmusk', count=100)

# Print data sample
print(tweets_df.head())

# Plot engagement metrics
plot_engagement(tweets_df)
Customizations
Change the User: Replace 'elonmusk' with any Twitter username you want to analyze.
Tweet Count: Adjust the count parameter in the get_user_tweets() function to fetch more or fewer tweets.
Advanced Analytics: Add sentiment analysis or other engagement metrics (e.g., replies, tweet duration).
Troubleshooting
API Rate Limits: Twitter has rate limits for API usage. If you exceed the limit, you may have to wait 15 minutes before making additional requests.
Invalid Credentials: Ensure your API keys are correct and have proper access privileges in your Twitter Developer Portal.
